## Introduction
Having spoken with the Chairperson of Clonmel Pride, we have decided that there is a definitive need for a website which displays and organises all of the Clonmel Pride information in one easy to use hub.
This site will allow users to navigate the site easily and intuitively using the navigation bar at the top of all pages, see upcoming events in a slideshow of posters and a summary of each day located below the poster slideshow, view a gallery containing images from current and previous Pride events, donate to the Pride organization through an external link to the festivals gofundme page, and contact the Pride committee directly through a contact form.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

-   Featured on all three pages, the fullly responsive navigation bar includes links to the “Home” page, “Gallery” page, donation section of the "Home" page, and a “Contact Us” page. This navigation bar is identical across all three pages, and fully responsive to screen size.
-   There is a logo in the top left corner of all pages which will link back to the “Home” page.
-   This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

The user is required to submit their full name, email address and a message to the pride team.

### Validator Testing

#### HTML
 -  No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
#### CSS
 -  No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Fixed Bugs

-   There was a white line on the right hand side of all pages. This was caused by the header being slightly lager than the background. Lowering header width fixed the issue.

### Unfixed Bugs
-   The donate navigation link at the top of the screen doesn't always navigate to the donate section while on mobile. It will always bring the user back to the index.html page but will sometimes not navigate to the donate section until the button is clicked again.
