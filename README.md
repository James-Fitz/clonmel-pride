## Live site available to view [here](https://james-fitz.github.io/portfolio-project-1/)

## Introduction
Having spoken with the Chairperson of Clonmel Pride, we have decided that there is a definitive need for a website which displays and organises all of the Clonmel Pride information in one easy to use hub.
This site will allow users to navigate the site easily and intuitively using the navigation bar at the top of all pages, see upcoming events in a slideshow of posters and a summary of each day located below the poster slideshow, view a gallery containing images from current and previous Pride events, donate to the Pride organization through an external link to the festivals gofundme page, and contact the Pride committee directly through a contact form.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar
	Featured on all three pages, the fullly responsive navigation bar includes links to the “Home” page, “Gallery” page, donation section of the "Home" page, and a “Contact Us” page. This navigation bar is identical across all three pages, and fully responsive to screen size.
o	There is a logo in the top left corner of all pages which will link back to the “Home” page.
    This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

### Future features that may be implemented
•	A larger gallery area which includes more pictures can be added at a future date, possibly adding separate pages for each year.
•	Implementation of a form to allow users to book events through the webpage using Eventbrite.
•	A section to livestream future Pride events that would be viewable by users.

## Testing

Testing of this webpage has been ongoing during the project.
The webpage was deployed half way through the completion of the project to ensure an appropriate amount of testing could be completed.
The website was tested fully on the following browsers: 
•	Google chrome.
•	Mozzilla Firefox
•	Brave
•	Safari
•	Android mobile
•	IOS mobile

All of the elements loaded correctly in an appropriate timeframe.
The webpage is responsive on all devices and different screen sizes to as low as 320px screen width.
All features worked as intended on all platforms. 
The navigation bar at the top of the page linked to all of the correct pages and sections. 
The logo loaded correctly and always linked back to the index.html page. The slideshow worked correctly on all platforms and screen sizes. 
The footer linked to all of the appropriate external areas on all platforms.  
The gallery page is viewable and correctly sized to ensure a pleasant user experience across all screen sizes. 
The “Donate” nav element will link the user back to the index.html page and navigate to the donate section of the page. 
The form requires users to fill in all information and cannot be submitted without a first name, last name, email address, radio box selection and message. Once submitted, users are taken to a thank you page for 5 seconds and the redirected to the home page. This feature works on all devices and browsers. 

### Validator Testing

HTML
 No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
 No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
### Fixed Bugs

There was a white line on the right hand side of all pages. This was caused by the header being slightly lager than the background. Lowering header width fixed the issue.

### Unfixed Bugs
 No unfixed bugs were left in the code.

## Deployment
This project was deployed using Github pages. The steps used to deploy the page are as follows:
•	In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
•	On the left hand side of the page, under “code and automation”, click on the “pages” section.
•	Select the “main” branch to deploy the page from.
•	Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
